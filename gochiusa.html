<p>EDIT 1: No this is not meant to be serious, just a fun exercise exploring a what-if scenario. Taking a plunge down the rabbit hole, if you will. In the words of Neil deGrasse Tyson:</p>

<p>EDIT 3: A lot of people have commented on Cocoa's part and the conclusion not really matching up with the rest of the essay. I might be rewriting this part soon. Need to put on more tinfoil hats first.</p>

<p>EDIT 4: Cocoa is an angel confirmed. Thanks to <="https://www.reddit.com/u/Grue">/u/Grue for providing this </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/I6dLS6x.jpg" height="50%"><p>irrefutable proof!</p>

<p>At first glance, <="http://myanimelist.net/anime/21273/Gochuumon_wa_Usagi_Desu_ka">Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? (or Gochiusa for short) might seems to be just another "cute girls doing cute things" slice of life. But I believe there is a darker secret to the show hidden beneath the fluffy surface. Is there more to this anime than meets the eye or am I just reading too much into this because I have nothing better to do?</p>

<p>Probably the later, but that's beside the point.</p>

<p>In this essay, I seek to prove my (completely sensible) theory that Gochiusa is set in an alternate reality where Japan has won World War II, and is now ruling over Europe. After that, I will discuss the characters and how their stories fit into this scenario. All supporting evidences  will be coming from the two seasons of the anime.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Gochiusa is set in Europe - after Japanese occupation.</strong></p>

<p>The story in Gochiusa is quite straightforward. One day Cocoa arrives in a certain town - where she will be living and working part time at the Rabbit House cafe. The show follows the daily lives of Cocoa and her friends as they have fun and generally be adorable. Pretty standard moe SOL fare, nothing to write home about. What makes Gochiusa stand out the most is its unusual setting.</p>

<p>Immediately upon watching episode 1, it is clear that </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/LnoJFOI.jpg" height="50%"><p>Gochiusa is not set in Japan. So where it is exactly? In the anime, it is referred to as the "wood-framed town", or simply "the town". Based on the architecture, we can tell that this place is located in Europe. In fact, it is no secret that this town is directly inspired by <="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colmar">Colmar - a real town located in the Northeast of France. Someone else has already made a <="https://infinitemirai.wordpress.com/2015/11/01/colmar-france-home-of-gochuumon-wa-usagi-desu-ka/">very detailed comparison so I won't go over it again.</p>

<p>So is Gochiusa set in Colmar, France? Maybe, maybe not. According the </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/nGWktbn.jpg" height="50%"><p>various signages around the town, the majority of the text seems to be a mixture of French, German, English and some Eastern European language. It is uncertain which country this is supposed to be, we can only be sure that it is located in Europe.</p>

<p>Now that we have established that Gochiusa is set in an Europe, we can safely assume that the majority of the characters are not Japanese, but European. We all know that eyes and hair color are meaningless in anime when it comes to identifying nationality, so let's look at names. Consider the first name of the five main girls (Cocoa, Chino, Rize, Chiya and Syaro), only Chiya and Rize are actual Japanese names. Chiya also happens to be the girl whose heritage is the most apparent - I'm 99.53% confident that </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/0IZ0YxE.jpg" height="50%"><p>she is Japanese. The same cannot be said for the other girls.</p>

<p>This brings up a question: If the characters are not Japanese and the town is not in Japan then why is everyone using Japanese? This is not a case of in this world the language barrier doesn't exist. Otherwise, Cocoa and Chiya </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/KGDFvvm.jpg" height="50%"><p> <p>would not have to study English. </p>

<p>Japanese influence goes beyond the usage of </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ELKxAoN.jpg" height="50%"><p>written and spoken language. As we can see, the main currency is </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/k1zBeqB.jpg" height="50%"><p>the Yen, not the Euro and the legislation system is using the </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/pAFuJM9.jpg" height="50%"><p>Six Codes - which is from Japan. Even more puzzling, the town does in fact, has a name - which </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/qvGiuzH.jpg" height="50%"><p>we can spot on Cocoa's letters to her family. Ogikubo - Suginami does not sound very European doesn't it?</p>

<p>What exactly is going on?</p>

<p>Here's my theory: Japan has won the second world war, and much of Europe has been occupied and under imperial rule ever since. It makes sense that the empire would enforce Japanese law and Japanese currency in occupied territories. They renamed the town from whatever it was into the name of <="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogikubo,_Tokyo">an area in Tokyo. A long enough time has passed that Japanese has become the main language for the common people - this land is now essentially annexed into Japan. </p>

<p>What's more, the war is most likely not yet over.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Where are the men? They are all drafted into military service.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you occasionally see other men in the town, but the number of actual male characters in Gochiusa can be counted on one hand. Is it easy to overlook the </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Jyx2gaq.jpg" height="50%"><p>lack of male characters in a show like Gochiusa, after all this is a moe SOL. However, when you consider that there is a war going on, a much more sinister scenario arises. And there is definitely a war - seeing as </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/8CKcQrz.jpg" height="50%"><p>both Chino's and Rize's fathers are ex-soldiers.</p>

<p>What is this war? Who is fighting whom and where? We do not know. What is clear is the lack of male presence in this town. Following along with our theory of Japanese occupation, the most logical explanation is that most of the men were conscripted into mandatory military service - so they are all presumably off fighting somewhere far away from home.</p>

<p>This explains why in such a picturesque town you would expect to see a lot of tourists, yet the cafes our girls are working in seems to be </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/1zVvtO7.jpg" height="50%"><p>empty all the time. Even on Christmas night, one of the </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZdUlK6k.jpg" height="50%"><p>rare occasions when the Rabbit House is actually full, the customers are almost entirely women. Also what about the lack of male students in high schools and middle schools? There are at least three different schools that the characters go to, yet </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/e8XJ2yh.jpg" height="50%"><p>we don't really see any boys around. Maybe they all go to female only schools? Unlikely.</p>

<p>But wait, what about Chino's dad and Rize's dad? They are men right? Remember that both of them are war veterans, and have seen their share of combat. They probably have already completed their terms of service and were released from military duty.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that out of all five main girls, only Chino and Rize still have fathers. None of the other girls had to worry about a gift for father's day besides these two. Chiya only has her grandmother and Syaro lives alone. Cocoa even </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/XSfp5IE.jpg" height="50%"><p>helped in making the gift for Chino's dad, but not for her own dad. When they were saying goodbye at the train station, her sister Mocha said that </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/e2v22Ht.jpg" height="50%"><p>mom is waiting for Cocoa at home, but there was no mention of their dad. The implication is clear: They no longer have a father. A war casualty perhaps?</p>

<p>Let's not forget Cocoa's two older brothers. Very little is known about them and they only </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/BiDPrmY.jpg" height="50%"><p>show up briefly in some flashback scene. At the end of season 2 we see </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/XShDrHU.jpg" height="50%"><p>her sister Mocha together with their mother at home, but the brothers are nowhere to be seen. Could it be that they are old enough to be serving in the army at this point?</p>

<p>Next, let's take a deeper look at each characters and how their backgrounds fit into this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rize is daughter of a warlord, she is being trained to become an assassin.</strong></p>

<p>When we first met her, Rize mentioned that she has been</p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/AVGnXUW.jpg" height="50%"><p> trained in self-defense ever since she was small. While most of us dismiss this fact as just another quirk that makes Rize even cuter (it really does), isn't it really weird when you think about it? Who train their little daughter in using firearms and CQC, drilling into her </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/FOCYgsY.jpg" height="50%"><p>military discipline at such a young age? While Rize tries to act like an </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/zjAKHeo.jpg" height="50%"><p>average highschool student as much as she can, at times she displays </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/uu8Gvv6.jpg" height="50%"><p>an alarming level of </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/T3yPke6.jpg" height="50%"><p>ruthlessness. Not to mention, no normal teenage girl is such a complete </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/TzM5Re8.jpg" height="50%"><p>gun nut or possess such </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/BSRrILm.jpg" height="50%"><p>incredible physical strength.</p>

<p>Considering that they were </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/1HByQ6i.jpg" height="50%"><p>both in the army together, Chino's father and Rize's father led utterly different lifestyles. The Kafu seems to live on modest mean, yet Rize's family is really wealthy - living in a </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/UY5zz1W.jpg" height="50%"><p>huge mansion complete with </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/lqVTpWX.jpg" height="50%"><p>maids and </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Szmftpr.jpg" height="50%"><p>bodyguards. We never really see police or any kind of crime (except those committed by rabbits) in this peaceful town, so why the heavy focus on security?</p>

<p>Rize's father is certainly not simply a soldier. While we do not know what he really does now, guessing that he is a underground warlord operating some kind of private military is probably not far from the truth. The man is ambitious, in training Rize to become </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/L3TIGcX.jpg" height="50%"><p>some kind of super soldier, he apparently has big plans for his daughter. Is he preparing her for the eventuality that the law will caught up to him, so that she could fend for herself should the need arises? Maybe he grooming Rize in case she has to take over his position in the organization? Or getting her ready for </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/szd4pZy.jpg" height="50%"><p>something even more sinister?</p>

<p>Rize also has a little bit of a father complex. This goes beyond </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/P4NV3y0.jpg" height="50%"><p>admiring her dad as a role model. Out of the five girls, Rize is the most mature and often act as the voice of reason for the group. Yet whenever her dad is involved, she becomes completely flustered. Like when she is </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZuGPrjE.jpg" height="50%"><p>too shy to give her dad his father's day present or grow totally red face </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/63uptYz.jpg" height="50%"><p>when he saw her in the maid uniform. And who can blame her, when daddy is both quite good looking and is a certified badass!</p>

<p>Another troubling sign: Rize has a stuffed rabbit toy called Wild Geese that </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/HIHobd9.jpg" height="50%"><p>she likes to cuddle in bed. Wild Geese </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/R9ShETq.jpg" height="50%"><p>wears a rifle on his back and has an eyepatch. Doesn't that remind you of </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/HZ9txeX.jpg" height="50%"><p>a certain one-eyed soldier? Rize seems to be rather fond of the name Wild Geese, as she gave the same name to the </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/jtf3oXO.jpg" height="50%"><p>feral rabbit taking up residence in Syaro's house.</p>

<p>Wild Geese is also the name of a mercenary group <="http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Irregular_military_organizations">according to the Metal Gear wikia. Seeing as the show likes to </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/DNUB8gD.jpg" height="50%"><p>reference Metal Gear, Rize's father could very well be a version of <="http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Boss">Big Boss.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Syaro is a war orphan, and she has amnesia.</strong></p>

<p>We know that Syaro is a poor teenage girl living by herself. She </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/WnWRvlj.jpg" height="50%"><p>works hard at multiple jobs to make a living and goes to a prestigious school thanks to earning a scholarship. What the show totally glosses over is the obvious fact that she is an orphan. Everyone else has at least some family members, but Syaro is alone.</p>

<p>How could a 15 years old girl afford </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/7nwSQW8.jpg" height="50%"><p>such a large house? The house might be run down but it is still in a prime street front location, not some shady back alley - seeing as Ama Usa An is right next to it. The answer is simple: she is not renting the place, because it has always been her home. </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/WRv1e6W.jpg" height="50%"><p>She grew up there.</p>

<p>How do we know this? In a flashback, we saw a </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/dFQNc5Y.jpg" height="50%"><p>young Syaro playing together with a young Chiya - this means two things. First, that they have always been friends and neighbors ever since they were little. Second, that Syaro must have had parents taking care of her back then. A 15 years old living alone is believable, but she could not have been on her own at such a young age.</p>

<p>What's worrying about Syaro is that she possibly </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/vJ5bNZt.jpg" height="50%"><p>has light amnesia. Chiya mentioned that </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/E8gSsq5.jpg" height="50%"><p>they used to play blowgun together and that Syaro was very good at it. Yet she is </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/gSPHFhq.jpg" height="50%"><p>completely baffled to discover her own excellent blowgun skills. Syaro </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/BxZQRpR.jpg" height="50%"><p>struggles to recall anything regarding the rivalry between Rabbit House and Ama Usa An, going so far as to keep hitting herself trying to remember. Whatever happened to Syaro and her parents was traumatic enough to create a mental block in her mind, making her forget certain events of the past.</p>

<p>Judging by her dress and toy back when she was young, as well as her </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/lfyiPlL.jpg" height="50%"><p>rather refined taste, Syaro was not always poor. Her </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/vDuqVE0.jpg" height="50%"><p>natural grace and elegant manner might be a result of her upbringing. This is also why Syaro is able to fit in perfectly with the rich girls at school, where no one suspected that she is actually poor. Whoever her parents were, they are gone - perhaps they had become victims of war. The fact that Syaro is all by herself now makes her an orphan.</p>

<p>Remember when Chiya was worried that Syaro </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Sun2m3k.jpg" height="50%"><p>might have been involved with some questionable establishments? This proves that her financial situation was desperate enough that the scenario of Syaro working for a cabaret (or something worse) is a very real concern. The girl is not exactly stable so it is a good thing that her </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/YiTbZmo.jpg" height="50%"><p>nextdoor childhood friend Chiya is </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/sI1wlkq.jpg" height="50%"><p>always looking out for her!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chiya is a foreigner, and the truth behind the rivalry between Ama Usa An vs Rabbit House.</strong></p>

<p>While the nationality of all the girls remains mysterious, Chiya is definitely Japanese - and she is </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/30atGCe.jpg" height="50%"><p>really proud of her heritage. Aside from her fascination for all things Japan, certain aspects of Chiya's character tell us without a doubt that this girl is Japanese and not just a </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/NI2ctMt.jpg" height="50%"><p>Japanophile.</p>

<p>Chiya </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/wG1ScUj.jpg" height="50%"><p>absolutely loves manzai comedy, and she </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/8feXCt2.jpg" height="50%"><p>takes any chance she can to play jokes on her friends. The girl is committed to </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/oZ2ous1.jpg" height="50%"><p>staying in character entirely, going so far as to gather up an entire basket of poisonous mushroom, just waiting for someone (the "straight man") to </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/mG71ryL.jpg" height="50%"><p>point out her error (the "punchline"). Manzai humor itself is very Japanese, not something that the average Western person would enjoy.</p>

<p>Yet when it comes to serious matters, Chiya has a tendency to not voice her feelings, we see this </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/brABWks.jpg" height="50%"><p>time and </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/LJ5lhFx.jpg" height="50%"><p>time and </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/yeT4tfe.jpg" height="50%"><p>time again. When she actually has to express something difficult, she does it in </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/XxznOFC.jpg" height="50%"><p>the most roundabout way possible. When Chiya wants to convince Syaro to work with her, she left a package of sweets with a note stating her wish instead of just saying it directly. This passive-aggressiveness and non direct approach are very typical Japanese traits.</p>

<p>We have other evidences regarding Chiya's origin as well. When she first came to Rabbit House, it is revealed that Chiya </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Frykq3D.jpg" height="50%"><p>has never seen a Western coffee menu before. While Chiya's kimono is part of work, her grandmother always wear the kimono although she is never in the front of house. Plus, Ama Usa An is</p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/WC7HqhM.jpg" height="50%"><p> nothing like all the other buildings in town - the place looks like something that belongs in, well Japan. We can safely say that Chiya and her grandmother are foreign to this land. They came from Japan to open a tea house in this European town.</p>

<p>This explains the </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/PnG2tpN.jpg" height="50%"><p>supposed rivalry between Ama Usa An and Rabbit House. How you ask? First we have to consider how exactly are these two establishments competitors in any way? They offer completely different products: Rabbit House sells coffee and Western pastries while Ama Usa An sells Japanese sweets and tea. Which means they are not directly competing in terms of products.</p>

<p>Second, it's not like Ama Usa An is directly next door to Rabbit House. Chino has to walk </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/gWO1XwI.jpg" height="50%"><p>quite a long distance to Ama Usa An in order to get medicines for a sick Cocoa. In fact, it is about </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/bwOUwuv.jpg" height="50%"><p>an hour trip back and forth. In this town, Rabbit House surely does not lack for competitions within the immediate vicinity before we even get anywhere near Ama Usa An. Which means they are not directly competing in terms of location.</p>

<p>If they are selling different products and are not even nearby, then why did the old master considered Ama Usa An a rival to Rabbit House? As it turns out, </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/4kT9oPN.jpg" height="50%"><p>the rivalry is only in his mind and Chiya's grandmother never thought anything about it. This is our hint to the truth. </p>

<p>Chino's grandfather is old, probably old enough that he can remember a time before the Japanese occupied this town. He held a grudge against the Japanese for taking over his home, and for marching his son off to war, leaving him a with struggling coffee house and a little girl to take care of. Ama Usa An stands out like a thorn in his eye because it represents everything that went wrong in his life. And now this Japanese tea house wants a piece of his business as well? The old man is having none of that.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the master is a good man. And we see that he actually adores Chiya just like with all the other girls. Unfortunately he still can't stand Ama Usa An, though </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hlu1TKm.jpg" height="50%"><p>for a different reason entirely.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chino had a lonely childhood and the master's last wish.</strong></p>

<p>Chino is a very polite, timid and reserved girl. Despite being rather mature and responsible for her age, she is quite shy around people, even with those close to her. This is a result of her growing up </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/dsM90lf.jpg" height="50%"><p>without much social interactions.</p>

<p>After meeting young Cocoa, the master mentioned that </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/wOncvF6.jpg" height="50%"><p>Chino gets lonely when Tippy (the rabbit) is not around. This tells us that she really has no other friends beside the angora rabbit.  She spent most of the time alone - therefore she does not know how to deal with people. Chino </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/f4R7CB6.jpg" height="50%"><p>lacks the social skills to make friends, and ended up keeping distance to everyone except those she is truly comfortable with. This explains why Chino </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/24SaeLX.jpg" height="50%"><p>always keep Tippy around whenever possible, because the rabbit's presence makes her feel at ease - although it seems like </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/kvVtDje.jpg" height="50%"><p>Cocoa is slowly taking over this role.</p>

<p>While it was only implied in the anime, in the manga it is stated that her mom died when she was younger. As for her dad, he was away at war during most of her childhood. When young Chiya and Syaro was checking out Rabbit House's menu - the old master </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/E34nyU3.jpg" height="50%"><p>was the only person there. And then there's Aoyama Blue Mountain who knew the master when she used to </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/NaMBGdO.jpg" height="50%"><p>frequent Rabbit House asking for his advice, yet </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/lfaINYO.jpg" height="50%"><p>she has never met Chino's dad before. It means that this entire time he was in the army and had only gotten back to manage the family business once grandpa has <del>passed away</del> turned into Tippy.</p>

<p>And it makes sense, as we've seen that Chino is rather adept at house chores - precisely because she is used to be by herself all the time. With her grandfather at work managing Rabbit House, her mom passed away, her dad away at war and no friends other than Tippy, </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/NB1dKU5.jpg" height="50%"><p>Chino must have had a lonely childhood.</p>

<p>This stress of having to take care of both the family business and Chino is probably what lead the old master to complain that he would rather </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/1YqOAHT.jpg" height="50%"><p>be a rabbit instead. We still don't know whether he truly died and then his "soul" somehow get  transferred into the body of Tippy or he simply ceased existing as a man and just become Tippy instead. Seeing as the rabbit was already the family pet even before the encounter with young Cocoa, I'm gonna go with the former theory: he died of old age but his soul lives on in Tippy.</p>

<p>I imagine the master was full of regrets before passing away: his country taken from him, his business struggling to stay afloat, his son is away in some war he wanted no part of. And most of all, he did not have the time to properly takes care of Chino. He told Cocoa that he wish to become a rabbit so he wouldn't have to work but I think what he really wanted deep inside was to spend time with his granddaughter and see her smile.</p>

<p>In the end, he got exactly what he wanted - now in the form of Tippy, he can make up to all the time he did not get to spend with Chino before, and he does not have to work anymore! As for Chino, she is slowly opening up and start </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/bL6xbK2.jpg" height="50%"><p>making friends, plus she now gets an </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/eYclqFZ.jpg" height="50%"><p>annoying older sister who fawn over her all the time!</p>

<p>A curious detail regarding Chino: she also has a </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/fN63fqS.jpg" height="50%"><p>one eyed stuffed bunny similar to Rize's. But in a flashback with her mom, we see the </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/kWXsJ8S.jpg" height="50%"><p>same rabbit had no eyepatch. So is this somehow connected to her mother? Does the eyepatch signify loss? And if so is Rize's mom gone as well?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cocoa is an angel sent by a higher force, her job is to make everyone happy.</strong></p>

<p>It is easy to dismiss Cocoa as the annoying klutzy genki girl. But she actually has a </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/cGiIVeH.jpg" height="50%"><p>very important role to fulfill - the reason why she came to this town in the first place. Before we talk about Cocoa, let's take a brief look back at the other girls:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rize is raised by a dangerous warlord and being trained into a killing tool for her father's own nefarious intention.</li>
<li>Syaro is a war orphan with amnesia, struggling to make ends meet everyday.</li>
<li>Chiya is coping to live a foreign land far away from her ancestral home, having to deal with hatred from the locals for the war crime committed by her people.</li>
<li>Chino grew up lonely with no friends, socially awkward and insecure.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we can see, most of the girls have rather unhappy background. They are all trying to move on from past traumas, striving to live a normal, peaceful life. This is the reason why Cocoa exists - according to my theory she must be an angel or supernatural entity and she was sent to this town by some higher force to </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/HCRnbYW.jpg" height="50%"><p>bring happiness to these girls.</p>

<p>Although Cocoa being Cocoa, she most certainly is not aware of her own true nature. Or she might have forgotten. Either way, there are many signs pointing toward the fact that Cocoa is not a normal girl. I'm sure you are tired of reading paragraphs at this point, so I present: bullet points!</p>

<ul>
<li>The most obvious display of her power is when she listened to the Rabbit House's old master's wish and </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/0o0Qtip.jpg" height="50%"><p>granted him exactly what he wants: to become a rabbit and spend time with his granddaughter a.k.a Cocoa makes people's wishes come true.</li>
<li>When Cocoa first started working at Rabbit House, she can </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Nj78hU6.jpg" height="50%"><p>immediately detect Rize's presence - Rize the super assassin who has been </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/l7QFrgw.jpg" height="50%"><p>trained in stealth since her childhood!</li>
<li>When finding the way to her new school, Cocoa displays her super dimensional walking power, constantly passing by Rize within the span of 5 minutes, prompting the poor girl </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/UJqjn1T.jpg" height="50%"><p>to question her own sanity.</li>
<li>Cocoa constantly demonstrates supernatural skills, but she has no idea how to properly use her powers. When trying to do cafeomancy she was able to </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/VMu6ykt.jpg" height="50%"><p>accurately predicts three future events, although she did not know those events would be </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/rsjZgbH.jpg" height="50%"><p>happening to herself.</li>
<li>In another display of inhuman genius, she can instantly completes the jigsaw puzzles that </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/YL3BV8z.jpg" height="50%"><p>takes Chino days to finish and then </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/IOMSqA9.jpg" height="50%"><p>unconsciously solves a difficult wire puzzle without breaking a sweat.</li>
<li>What about her amazing ability to </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/5OZ0QPd.jpg" height="50%"><p>make instantaneous calculations or to memorize prime numbers? During their study session at Chiya's house, she can easily </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/x3ObEOx.jpg" height="50%"><p>list every prime number up to the thousands before getting distracted by a picture album.</li>
<li>Cocoa can create life! We see her </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/5XPErik.jpg" height="50%"><p>making a snow rabbit shortly before getting sick. Over night it had spawned </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/22JGEPf.jpg" height="50%"><p>at least three other baby snow rabbits!</li>
<li>During their camping trip in the mountain, Cocoa </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/FVFiJqG.jpg" height="50%"><p>shares her power with Chino, helping her to fish with powerful fluffy magic.</li>
<li>In front of Chino's camera, Cocoa can </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/8kC2J3F.jpg" height="50%"><p>instantly make a pose at such lightning speed that even Rize could not react in time.</li>
<li>Cocoa is a being </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Kg9BUFY.jpg" height="50%"><p>made of pure love. She famously stated that </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hy4WuhN.jpg" height="50%"><p>if she knows you for 3 seconds then you are her friend. Plus, she has proven time and time again that </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/oVmufa5.jpg" height="50%"><p>she can be instantly happy no matter what. Just her presence alone is enough to </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/x1G4w3P.jpg" height="50%"><p>bring these girls together, adding </p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/UzRingV.jpg" height="50%"><p>a little bit of happiness into their unfortunate lives. This tells us that Cocoa's main function is to bring joy and love to the people around her.</li>
